Its funny how the distance can make you feel close
And the things you lost are the things you want most
The weathers fine here a perfect shade of blue
I guess that's why I have been thinking of you

So I call you up just to tell you why
Why I left you and say goodbye
Ooh must be the mood I'm in
I'm thinking of you again
I call you up just to tell you why
Why I left you and say goodbye
